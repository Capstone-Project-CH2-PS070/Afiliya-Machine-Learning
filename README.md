# Product Detection Recommendation and Affiliate Tracking Model

The Product Detection Recommendation and Affiliate Tracking Model is an innovative system that combines several advanced functionalities to revolutionize the way cultural products are detected, recommended, and tracked within the affiliate marketing landscape.

## Overview

This model integrates cutting-edge technologies in computer vision, recommendation systems, affiliate tracking, and cultural detection to cater specifically to the needs of cultural product promotion and sales. The primary goal is to create a robust system that facilitates the following key functions:

- **Product Detection:** Employs advanced recommendation algorithms by images to suggest culturally relevant products to users based on their preferences.

- **Affiliate Tracking:** Tracks affiliate marketing efforts by monitoring product referrals, clicks, and purchases made through affiliate links, ensuring fair compensation to affiliates for driving sales.

- **Culture Detection:** Incorporates machine learning models to identify and categorize cultural aspects, enabling precise tagging and classification of products based on their cultural attributes.

- **Product Verification** Utilizes computer vision models to compare the received product's image with the reference image stored in the application's database at the time of order.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Product Detection Recommendation:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning (RESNET50).

- **Affiliate Tracking:** Customized tracking algorithms, Cookie-based tracking, Referral link management.

- **Culture Detection:** Machine Learning models image classification.

- **Product Verification:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Image Feature Extraction Algorithms.

## Goals

The primary objective of this model is to enhance the promotion and sales of cultural products by providing a sophisticated system that accurately detects, recommends, and verifies these products. The goals include:

- Empowering cultural businesses by increasing the visibility and accessibility of their products to a global audience.

- Facilitating the seamless integration of affiliate marketing strategies to incentivize promotion and sales efforts.

- Ensuring authenticity and trust in cultural products, thereby encouraging customers to engage and purchase confidently.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload an image of the received product through the application The system compares the uploaded image with the reference image associated with the order in the database.

2. **Feature Extraction and Verification:** Key visual features are extracted and compared, generating a verification score or result indicating the similarity between the images.

3. **Detection:** The culture detection functionality within our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models to identify and categorize cultural aspects inherent within products

4. **User Feedback:** Users can provide feedback on the verification result, contributing to the system's accuracy and improvements.
   
5. **Affiliate:** Real-time product tracking and inventory management systems.
